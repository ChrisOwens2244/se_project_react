# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user. The user can add and delete clothes to their list by calling a different api to save or delete clothes from a server.

## Technology used:

-React: used to create the fornt-end for the project.
-JSON: used to create a mock server to store data.
