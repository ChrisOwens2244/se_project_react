# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user. The user can add and delete clothes to their list by calling a different api to save or delete clothes from a server.

## Technology used:

-React: used to create the fornt-end for the project.
-Mongoose DB: The server created in project 13 has been linked to this project by changing the port that data is shared with. From there the ablity to log in users and save likes has been added.
